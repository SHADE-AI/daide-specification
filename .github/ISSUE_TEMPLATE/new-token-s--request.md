**What functionality will your new tokens add?**
A clear and concise description of what the new tokens will add to the existing communication specification.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
- A specific list of the tokens to add and what types of DAIDE clauses they work with.
- The level that these tokens will live under. This should either be a new level, or an existing level above 130, in order to preserve levels that exist in the original DAIDE specification.

**Additional context**
